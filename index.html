        You are a security guard at a large company, your job is to look over the cameras. <br>
        Finding yourself bored you decide to make a game from the people walking in a hallway  <br>
        on one of the cameras. As many people walk past the hallway you decide to figure out  <br>
        the minimum steps it will take before 2 people cross or come into contact with each  <br>
        other (assuming every person takes a step at the same time). <br>
        <br>
        People are represented as arrows, < for a person moving left and > for a person moving  <br>
        right and - for an empty space <br>
        <br>
        A step represents a person moving forward one -, each person moves 1 step at the same time <br>
        <br>
        in this example the first people to come in contact with each other do it after 1 step <br>
        ---><---- <br>
        in this example the first people to come in contact with each other do it after 1 step <br>
        --->-<------->----<- <br>
        in the case that no people come in contact return -1 <br>
        ----<----->---- <br>
